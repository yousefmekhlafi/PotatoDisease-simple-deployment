App status: FUNCTIONAL

Tested on postman and streamlit

How to run:

Option 1: 
Fork repository and run on VS code
type in command "streamlit run app.py" on CMD terminal

Option 2: 
Use cloud services for containerizing and deployment using your own resources

DESCRIPTION AND DISCALIMERS:

This is a deep learning multiple classification app for detecting a potato plant disease: a multiple classification algorithm for healthy, early, late classes.

The deep learning algorithm was developed and coded along with Codebasics YT channel.

ChatGPT was thoroughly used for learning and assisting purposes. 

PROJECT SCOPE AND METHODOLOGY: 

note: the entirety of the project was made in a virtual environment on VS code.

1. Learning and practicing python and deep learning 

2. Learn how to develop a deep learning multiple class classifier on a jupyter notebook and save the model

3. Learning the OOP aspects of python (functions and importing functions for re-usable code)

4. Make a habit of working on a simple jupyter notebook experiment, and using a simple project structure first. Then turn the code into industry standard stage-based modular coding for production grade later.

5. Learn how to prepare and process input data (images) for a deep learning model's acceptable input parameters 

6. Learn how to make a prediction script for loading the model into the app

7. Learn how to package the model into a deployable package

8. Learn how to deploy the model locally via streamlit in a simple manner 

9. Learn how to dockerize the project for deployment on cloud services (Azure, AWS, GCP)
